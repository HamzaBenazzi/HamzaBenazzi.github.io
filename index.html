                            <h3>Marriage and the Class Structure</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the recent trends in marriage rates in the U.S. from 2000 to 2021, focusing on the role of wage structure and work hours explaining these changes. Using IPUMS data, I show that the wage structure changed as well as a significant reduction in work hours for men across all income groups, with a slight increase for women. This study highlights that work hours, not just wages, significantly influence marriage patterns. The analysis finds that reductions in male work hours may increase marriage probability, suggesting that time availability is a crucial factor in household dynamics. A marriage model calibrated to 2000 and tested with 2021 data supports the hypothesis that changes in work hours better explain recent marriage trends than changes in wages. This paper contributes to understanding economic determinants of marriage by emphasizing the critical role of work hours.

                            <p>
                                <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we construct a model in which individuals decide between private and public education. We study the effect of this decision on income inequality. In particular, we analyze the effect of three policies on the middle class, namely: an increase in government spending on public education, an increase in income tax, and an improvement in the productivity of public education. Our main finding is that increasing government spending on public education reduces the future income of the middle class by prompting parents in this group to opt out of private education.

                            <p>
                                <strong>Abstract:</strong> In the face of persistently rising income inequality, the capacity to redistribute becomes essential, especially when involving human capital production. Using the case of public education funding across US school districts between 2005 and 2019, we document a negative response of local funding to higher inequality. We then show that this negative response is driven by lower redistribution in poorer districts whereas in rich districts the tax base positive effect dominates. Our results, in line with recent theoretical work, emphasize a new inequality amplification mechanism.
